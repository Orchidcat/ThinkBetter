"Centre to Top" or C-T is the length from bottom bracket centre to top of seat tube. Useful because you can measure it and **helps you work out how much seatpost you need**.

"Centre to Centre" or C-C is the length from bottom bracket centre to the middle of where the top tube meets the seat tube. Was a bit more useful when bikes were made without sloping top tubes. **非倾斜上管该参数更有用**

"Effective" is the length from the bottom bracket centre to the point where a horizontal line from the top of the head tube meets the seat tube axis. **Less commonly used.**

One of these is often used as an overall measure of a bike's size.

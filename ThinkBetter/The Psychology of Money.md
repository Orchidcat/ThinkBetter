Good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns , It's about pretty good returns which can be repeated for the longest period of time.

Good investing is not necessarily about make good decisions. it's about consistently not screwing up.

Wealth vs Rich

Wealth is income， rich is outcome.
have money is not to spend money. restraint it takes to actually be wealthy.




学会使用更少的钱来创造快乐，将会在你拥有和你想要中间创造出一个间隙。这个间隙就是你能控制的范围。

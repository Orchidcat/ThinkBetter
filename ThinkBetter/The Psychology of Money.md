Good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns , It's about pretty good returns which can be repeated for the longest period of time.

Good investing is not necessarily about make good decisions. it's about consistently not screwing up.



Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money is different strategy. Compounding works. **Time**
The Survival mindset
1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.
2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.</mark>A plan is only useful if it can survive reality.
3. optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital. Growth amid loss.

大多数上市公司将失去其大部分的价值，最终也无法恢复。这样的比例高达70%，只有7%左右的公司得以盈利。并且这少数的7%仍然有很长的 <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">tail events</mark> 。

no one makes good decisions all the time.

一些反直觉的，投资不是一直在盈利区，反而是要部分投入在风险区。

Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.

Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.


好车名表并不能让你对持有他们的人表达敬意。相反，你在看到这些东西的时候，想到的是自己拥有它时候的样子。 



that wealth is what you don’t see.
想成为亿万富翁，通常考虑的是花掉亿万，这正好与成为亿万富翁相反。（财富的定义是不乱花钱）


Wealth vs Rich

Wealth is income， rich is outcome.
have money is not to spend money. restraint it takes to actually be wealthy.




学会使用更少的钱来创造快乐，将会在你拥有和你想要中间创造出一个间隙。这个间隙就是你能控制的范围。


That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.



学术金融致力于寻找数学上最优的投资策略。而现实情况是人们在寻找的并非数学上的最优投资策略。


预测本身是合乎人性的合理行为，但其本身的预测结果并非理性。
历史是对变化的研究，讽刺的是，它被用作未来的地图；
**历史可以做什么，校准期望，研究哪里容易出现问题，提供一个粗略的指导**。


The most important driver of anything tied to money is the stories people tell themselves and the preferences they have for goods and services. Those things don’t tend to sit still. They change with culture and generation. They’re always changing and always will.


经验比预测能力更容易导致过度自信。

安全边际的目的是使预测变得不必要。——Benjamin Graham


在做一个长期决定时，应该考虑的：
 1. 避免财务规划的极端结果；当给一个计划，几年或者几十年的增长时，将会是一个比较好的过程。当你考虑到我们随着时间的推移而改变自己的倾向时，在生活的每一点上保持平衡就成了一种避免未来后悔和鼓励忍耐的策略。

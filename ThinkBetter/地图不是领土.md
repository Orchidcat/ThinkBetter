## **[The Map is Not the Territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/)**

>The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists. This is important to keep in mind as we think through problems and make better decisions.


# 总结：
任何对现实的抽象，都是对现实的一种缩减。抽象本身将会对事物产生类似快照的描述，而快照描述的是不在存在的事物。

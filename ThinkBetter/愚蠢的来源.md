# 愚蠢的来源

1. 无意中的愚蠢（认识偏差持续存在。过度关注目标，群体愚蠢等）
2. 错误的信息
3. 使用错误的模型
4. 没有学习
5. 审视做好这件事（Our evolutionary programming conditions us to do what’s easy over what’s right. After all it’s often easier to signal being virtuous than actually being virtuous. We unconsciously make choices based on optics, politics, and defendability. We hate criticism and seek the validation of our peers and superiors. We often want to feel good about ourselves first and have the outcome we desire second.）

Some things I believe：

- As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences
	- Technology, which is really [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity), enables this
	- You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor

- Enthusiasm matters!
	- It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
	- #？ It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason 
	- Energy is a necessary input for progress

- **It's important to do things fast**
	- You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
	- Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit
	- "Slow is fake"
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A week is 2% of the year</mark>
	- Time is the denominator （时间是分母）

- **We know lese than we think**
	- the replication crisis is not an aberration
	- Many of the things we believe are wrong
	- we are often not even asking the right questions 

- The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful (传统习惯在微观的管理是有害的。社会默认属性的无意识控制)
	- Great individuals should be fully empowered to exercise their judgment
	- The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension
	- The downsides are worth it

- Where do you get your dopamine?
	- The answer is predictive of your behavior
	- **Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated**
	- It's ok to get yours from "making things happen"

- You can do more than you think
	- We are tied down by invisible orthodoxy （我们被无形的正统束缚）
	- The laws of physics are the only limit

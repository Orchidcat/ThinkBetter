Width originally specified as part of the complete bike.

Road bike bars are usually chosen with **the rider's shoulder width** in mind. If you're super aero though, you might go narrower to keep your frontal area small.

MTB bars have been growing steadily from under 700mm to over 800mm, giving more leverage and thus stability (but occasionally clipping trees!).

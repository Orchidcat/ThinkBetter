The vertical distance from the centre of the bottom bracket to the centre-top of the head tube, where the virtual steering axis passes through.

A low stack feels low, aero and racy. Go too low and your back and neck might start to ache on longer rides, though.

Stack and reach go hand-in-hand to give a useful X-Y position of the front of the bike, before you add a stem (and consider its length, angle and any spacers).

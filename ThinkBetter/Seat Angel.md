Seat tube angle. Steeper (larger) places you further forward while seated, slacker (smaller) stretches you out more.

When descending on a mountain bike you'll often be standing, so designers can focus seat angle on climbing performance - this is why MTB seat angles have become much steeper recently.

On mountain bikes where seat tube does not intersect the BB, we use the 'effective' angle.
**在座管不与 BB 相交的山地自行车上，我们使用“有效”角度。**

On time trial bikes, the saddle can often be repositioned to give a wide range of effective seat angles. This is all about optimising sustainable power for the individual.
**速度赛通常使用坐垫调整**
